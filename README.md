# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts a student’s **math score** using demographic and academic data.  
This project covers the complete ML workflow — data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 🚀 Overview
- Built an ML model to predict student math performance
- Compared multiple regression algorithms and selected the best using R² score
- Deployed the trained model as a Flask web application for real-time predictions

## 🧠 Models Used
Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, CatBoost, Flask

## ▶️ Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/souravkumar-cloud/Student_Performance_Prediction.git
cd Student_Performance_Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
